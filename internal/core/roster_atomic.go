// role, family, created pane, cwd, started, model, approvals, roles and
// lane all together — a row whose owner or session fields changed
// concurrently is a different line and is never removed). A second row for
// the same pane that is not the verified row — a duplicate of the verified
// row, a replaced row, or a row added after the caller's check — is a
// corrupt-roster refusal, never a removal that would leave the caller's
// pane holding a worker row. removed is true only when exactly one
// matching line and no other row for the pane was rewritten out. err is
// non-nil when the roster exists but is unreadable (a read failure is
// propagated, never reported as a vanished row), when the roster is
// corrupt, when beforeRemove refuses, or on a failed rewrite; on a failed
// rewrite the file keeps its previous content, because platform.AtomicWrite
