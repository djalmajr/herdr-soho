// missing or denied, asks for at most one minimal version probe per
// required runtime in the actual worker sandbox (only when the brief opts
// in with a `## Runtime capability probe` section naming the required
// commands), records the exact command/exit/result, forbids repeated
// identical denied attempts, routes the blocked gate to an
// orchestrator-produced log of the same revision, keeps the proof
// [partial] until resolved, and requires external evidence to be checked
// for command/source/revision before it may resolve the item.
const sandboxWinRuntimeNote = "- Your sandbox may not have the runtimes your brief requires (node, bun or another) or may deny them even with full approvals, so a check on the host PATH is not proof about this sandbox. If your brief carries a `## Runtime capability probe` section naming the required commands, run at most one minimal version probe per required runtime in this worker sandbox and record the exact command, exit code and result; never repeat an identical denied probe. A denied or missing runtime keeps its item [partial]; route the blocked gate to the orchestrator for an orchestrator-produced log of the same revision; check any external evidence for the same command, source and revision before letting it resolve the item, and it must never silently turn an unresolved [partial] into a pass.\n"
